/**
 * Tells graphql-base where the Stripe checkout mutations live. The result
 * types are payment-base's (`Checkout*Result`), so no type namespace here.
 *
 * Mirrors `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Framework\NamespaceMapperInterface`
 * WITHOUT implementing it, on purpose: graphql-base is optional for this
 * module, and module activation compiles the container, whose compiler
 * passes reflect (load) the class of every service. A class implementing an
 * interface from an absent package is a fatal "Interface not found" and the
 * module cannot be activated on a shop without GraphQL (payment-base's CI
 * died on exactly that). graphql-base only iterates the tagged services and
 * calls the two methods. OptionalGraphQlDependencyTest pins the parity.
