 * Interface for delivery address hash management.
 *
 * Sprint 20: Encapsulates $_REQUEST modification for delivery address validation.
 *
 * OXID's Order::validateDeliveryAddress() reads from $_REQUEST['sDeliveryAddressMD5'].
 * When returning from Stripe checkout, the original form data is lost, so we need
 * to restore this value for validation to pass.
 *
 * SOLID Principles:
 * - SRP: Single responsibility - delivery address hash for OXID validation
 * - ISP: Focused interface with hash operations only
 * - DIP: Handlers depend on this abstraction, not direct $_REQUEST manipulation
 *
 * @since 2.0.0
