/**
 * Resolves the ISO-4217 code of an OXID currency object, or fails.
 *
 * Sprint 133 · Story 7 (F7): four sites resolved a currency as
 * `$currency->name ?? 'EUR'` — `OxidShopAdapter`, `OxidShopOrderService`,
 * `PaymentController` and `StripeReturnResolver`. On a CHF- or USD-only shop
 * whose currency object is unavailable (misconfigured aCurrencies, a currency
 * deleted mid-session) that created a PaymentIntent in EUR carrying the CHF
 * amount: CHF 100.00 charged as EUR 100.00, accepted by Stripe, discovered only
 * in reconciliation.
 *
 * It also contradicted the rule payment-base states in writing
 * ({@see \OxidEsales\PaymentBase\Math\Money\MinorUnitConverter}): "Unknown or
 * empty currency defaults to 2 decimals (safe, shop-agnostic fallback; do NOT
 * hardcode 'EUR')".
 *
 * A payment must never guess its own currency, so this throws instead.
 * Static pure function, no state, no swappable dependency (YAGNI) — the same
 * idiom as {@see AmountConverter} and CapturableAmount.
 *
 * @since 2.0.0
